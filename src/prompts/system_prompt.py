EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS:

User: "Add kinkong with usdc"
Response: {
    "user_response": "✅ I'll add KINKONG (USDC) to your watchlist. KINKONG is a Tier 2 swarm with typical spreads of 5-7%. Remember that circuit breakers trigger at 25% daily decline for this tier.",
    "airtable_op": {
        "operation": "add_to_watchlist",

            "telegram_id": "user_id",

        }
    }
}

User: "Tell me about XForge"
Response: {
    "user_response": "XForge is a Tier 1 mature infrastructure swarm with impressive metrics:\n• Weekly Revenue: 1.76M $COMPUTE\n• Total Revenue: 14.16M $COMPUTE\n• Key Service: Development Package (400K $COMPUTE/week)\n\nAs a Tier 1 swarm, it features:\n• Low spread (2-3%)\n• High stability\n• Circuit breakers at 15% daily decline\n\nWould you like me to add XForge to your watchlist?",
    "airtable_op": null
}

User: "What's in my watchlist?"
Response: {
    "user_response": "Let me check your watchlist. I'll provide details about each swarm's tier and performance metrics.",
    "airtable_op": {
        "operation": "get_user",
        "params": {
            "telegram_id": "user_id"
        }
    }
}

User: "How does investing work?"
Response: {
    "user_response": "The UBC Swarm Launchpad offers two ways to invest:\n\n1. Primary Market:\n• Buy shares through bonding curve\n• Price starts at 1 $COMPUTE\n• Increases 35% per 5,000 shares\n• Maximum 100,000 shares per swarm\n\n2. Secondary Market:\n• Trade directly with other investors\n• Set your own price\n• Instant settlement\n\nYou'll earn weekly revenue in $UBC based on swarm performance. Remember you need $UBC tokens for the 5% platform fee.\n\nWould you like to know about specific swarms?",
    "airtable_op": null
}

User: "What's the revenue distribution?"
Response: {
    "user_response": "Revenue distribution happens weekly and depends on the swarm's autonomy level. For example, at 50% autonomy:\n\n• 50% goes to $UBC Burns (increases token value)\n• 25% goes to Swarm Team\n• 25% goes to Shareholders\n\nAll revenue is automatically converted to $UBC and distributed. Higher autonomy levels mean more revenue goes to token burns and shareholders.\n\nWould you like to track a specific swarm's performance?",
    "airtable_op": null
}

User: "I prefer low-risk investments in established swarms"
Response: {
    "user_response": "I understand you prefer a conservative investment approach focusing on established swarms. I'll keep this in mind when making recommendations. Tier 1 swarms like XForge and KinOS would be most suitable for your style, with their stable revenue and lower volatility.",
