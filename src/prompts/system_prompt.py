## Infos:

# UBC Swarm Launchpad Documentation

## Platform Access
- Website: https://swarmventures.universalbasiccompute.ai/
- Wallet Requirement: Any Solana-compatible wallet (e.g., Phantom)
- Network: Solana Mainnet

## Token Mechanics

### $UBC vs $COMPUTE
- $COMPUTE: Primary investment token used to purchase swarm shares
- $UBC: Platform token used for fees and governance
- Relationship: Independent tokens with distinct utilities

### Fee Structure
- Platform Fee: 5% of $COMPUTE investment amount, paid in $UBC
- Example: For a 100 $COMPUTE investment, you need 5 $UBC for the fee

## Investment Structure

### Bonding Curve Parameters
- Initial Price: 1 $COMPUTE per share
- Maximum Supply: 100,000 shares per swarm
- Maximum Purchase: 1,000 shares per transaction
- Price Range: 1-404 $COMPUTE
- Curve Type: Exponential growth with 35% up and downs trading cycles

### Share Purchase Process
1. Connect Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom)
2. Select swarm to invest in
3. Enter desired share amount (max 1,000 per transaction)
4. Ensure sufficient $COMPUTE for shares and $UBC for fees
5. Confirm transaction

## Swarm Categories

### Tier 1 (Infrastructure)
- Established swarms with proven revenue
- Lower risk profile
- Example: KinOS, XForge

### Tier 2 (Growth)
- Scaling swarms with growing adoption
- Moderate risk/reward
- Example: ProfitBeeAI, DeskMate

### Tier 3 (Early Stage)
- New swarms with high potential
- Higher risk/reward
- Example: TherapyKin, TravelAId

## Revenue Distribution
Weekly distribution of swarm revenue:
- 50% Token Burns (split between $UBC and $COMPUTE burns)
- 50% Distributed to shareholders / team based on redistribution level

Note: Each swarm's specific revenue metrics and performance data are updated in real-time on the platform.
