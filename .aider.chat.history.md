  ```json
  {
    "telegramId": "string",
    "walletAddress": "string",
    "subscriptionDate": "ISO-8601",
    "lastDistribution": {
      "amount": "number",
      "date": "ISO-8601",
      "txHash": "string"
    },
    "status": "active|inactive"
  }
  ```
- Track wallet addresses with verification status

#### SwarmVentures - AI-native investment @UBC, [13/02/2025 22:55]  
#### Great timeline! Let's optimize for fastest time-to-value by splitting this into two phases:  
####   
#### Phase 1 - Core Notification System (3 days):  
#### - Telegram bot implementation  
#### - Watchlist management (manual entry via Airtable)  
#### - Price threshold monitoring  
#### - Direct trading page links  
####   
#### Phase 2 - Full Automation (2 days):  
#### - Self-service subscription system  
#### - Payment processing  
#### - User management automation  
#### - Analytics dashboard  
####   
#### This way we can:  
#### 1. Start providing value to users immediately  
#### 2. Gather feedback on the notification system  
#### 3. Manually onboard initial users through Airtable  
#### 4. Refine the offering before adding payment automation  
####   
#### Should we begin with the Phase 1 technical specification?  
####   
#### SwarmVentures - AI-native investment @UBC, [13/02/2025 23:00]  
#### We've prepared the technical specification for the market notification service, focusing on a two-phase approach with manual user management first:  
####   
#### https://swarms.universalbasiccompute.ai/specifications/spec-47-20250213-043711  
####   
#### Key points:  
#### - Phase 1: Core notification system with manual user management  
#### - Phase 2: Full automation with subscription handling  
####   
#### The n8n workflows look straightforward, and we can leverage Airtable for the MVP user management. Ready to start with the Telegram bot implementation?

> Add URL to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: d  

I'll help you update the SPEC.md to reflect this new two-phase approach. We should modify the Implementation Timeline section and add a new Phasing Strategy section. Here are the changes to make:

Add this new section before the Implementation Timeline:

```markdown
## Phasing Strategy

### Phase 1 - Core Notification System (3 days)
- Telegram bot implementation
- Watchlist management (manual entry via Airtable)
- Price threshold monitoring
- Direct trading page links

Benefits:
- Immediate value delivery to users
- Early feedback collection
- Manual user onboarding via Airtable
- Opportunity to refine offering

### Phase 2 - Full Automation (2 days)
- Self-service subscription system
- Payment processing
- User management automation
- Analytics dashboard
```

Replace the existing Implementation Timeline section with:

```markdown
## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Days 1-3)
#### Day 1: Bot Setup
- Telegram bot implementation
- Basic command structure
- Integration with Airtable

#### Day 2: Monitoring System
- Price monitoring implementation
- Threshold configuration
- Alert system setup

#### Day 3: User Interface
- Trading page link generation
- Alert formatting
- Initial user testing

### Phase 2 (Days 4-5)
#### Day 4: Automation
- Subscription system implementation
- Payment processing setup
- User database migration

#### Day 5: Dashboard & Testing
- Analytics dashboard development
- System integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Security review
```

These changes better reflect the new phased approach while maintaining clear deliverables and timelines. Would you like me to make any adjustments to these sections?

#### okay, we'll do a python project. Let's start with the /start features (and let's do the initialization commands and repo structure)  

I'll help you set up the initial Python project structure for the Telegram bot. Let's create a clean, modular structure that will be easy to extend for Phase 2.

1. First, create this directory structure:
```
bot/
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── main.py
└── src/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── bot/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── commands.py
    │   └── handlers.py
    ├── config/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── settings.py
    └── utils/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── airtable.py
```

2. Create `.gitignore`:
```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
venv/
.env

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# Logs
*.log
```

3. Create `requirements.txt`:
```
python-telegram-bot>=20.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
pyairtable>=2.0.0
```

4. Create `.env.example`:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Users
```

5. Create `main.py`:
```python
import logging
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from telegram.ext import ApplicationBuilder, CommandHandler

from src.bot.commands import start_command

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    level=logging.INFO
)

def main():
    # Initialize bot
    app = ApplicationBuilder().token(os.getenv('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN')).build()
    
    # Add command handlers
    app.add_handler(CommandHandler('start', start_command))
    
    # Start the bot
    app.run_polling()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

6. Create `src/bot/commands.py`:
```python
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import ContextTypes

async def start_command(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    """Handle the /start command"""
    welcome_message = (
        "🚀 Welcome to SwarmVentures Trading Bot!\n\n"
        "I'll help you track market opportunities and manage your trading positions.\n\n"
        "Available commands:\n"
        "/start - Show this welcome message\n"
        "/help - Show available commands\n"
        "/watchlist - View your watchlist\n"
    )
    
    await update.message.reply_text(welcome_message)
```

7. Create `src/config/settings.py`:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Telegram Settings
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = os.getenv('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN')

# Airtable Settings
AIRTABLE_API_KEY = os.getenv('AIRTABLE_API_KEY')
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = os.getenv('AIRTABLE_BASE_ID')
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME = os.getenv('AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME')
```

8. Create `src/utils/airtable.py`:
```python
from pyairtable import Table
from src.config.settings import AIRTABLE_API_KEY, AIRTABLE_BASE_ID, AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME

class AirtableClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.table = Table(AIRTABLE_API_KEY, AIRTABLE_BASE_ID, AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME)
    
    def get_user(self, telegram_id: str):
        """Get user by Telegram ID"""
        records = self.table.all(formula=f"{{telegram_id}}='{telegram_id}'")
        return records[0] if records else None
    
    def create_user(self, telegram_id: str, username: str):
        """Create new user"""
        return self.table.create({
            "telegram_id": telegram_id,
            "username": username,
            "status": "active"
        })
```

To get started:

1. Create a new Telegram bot using @BotFather and get the token
2. Set up an Airtable base with a Users table
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
4. Create a virtual environment and install requirements:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the bot:
```bash
python main.py
```

This gives you a basic structure with:
- Clean project organization
- Environment variable management
- Basic /start command
- Airtable integration ready
- Logging configured

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or move on to implementing additional commands?
